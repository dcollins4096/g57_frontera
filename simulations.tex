\section{Simulations}

Here we describe and motivate the physical layout of the simulations.

\subsection{Turbulence}

The turbulence simulations begin with uniform density and magnetic field, and
add kinetic energy at each step in a way that the kinetic energy in the box
stays constant.  Energy  is added at the large scale, and the nonlinear dynamics
of the MHD equations carry that energy to smaller scales until it is ultimately
dissipated.  The cascade is what we are interested in, as it gives
