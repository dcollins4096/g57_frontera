\caption{The request broken down by simulation.  For the \emph{turbulence}
simulations, the duration, $T$ and time step,
$\Delta t$, are determined by \mach\ and \alfmach.  For the \emph{galaxy}
simulations, the AMR structure will be constructed in layers of grids with
$32^3$ zones each centered on the midplane of the galaxy. The outer box, level
0, is
$8.2\sci{5}$pc on a side, and the finest level has a resolution of 6.25 pc.
For all simulations, the number of updates for each level is $N_U=T/\Delta t$.  The
total cost $SU=N_Z * T/\Delta t / \zeta / N_C * N_N$, and
The total disk is $4*N_Z*N_F*N_D$ bytes, where $N_F$ is the number of fields and
$N_D$ is the number of outputs saved. }
