We will perform two suites of simulations; one will be a pair of high resolution $2048^3$
simulations of plasma turbulence, and the other will be three high resolution
AMR simulations of isolated galaxies.  There will be many things to measure from
these simulations, our first focus is to study the observed polarization produced by
plasma turbulence in the galaxy.  The study of this dusty, magnetized turbulence
will allow us to remove the polarization signal due to our own galaxy from the
polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).  This, in turn, will
allow us to see gravitational waves from the big bang.

The code we will use is Enzo \citep{Collins10, Bryan14}.  This is an open source
adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code that has been used for many astrophysical
applications on the world's largest computers.  Enzo uses higher order Godunov
methods to solve the MHD equations, fourier transform based methods for gravity,
and the algorithm of \citet{Berger89} for the AMR.  The code also includes
chemistry and star particles, but their cost is negligible compared to the MHD,
Gravity, and AMR.  Here we will profile the performance of the three primary
systems in the manner they will be used in the proposed simulations.
